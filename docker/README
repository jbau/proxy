Add a wavefront.conf file with at least the following things defined:

server=https://.../api
hostname=...
token=...

Then:

docker build -t wavefront/agent .

Run:

docker run -d -p 2878:2878 wavefront/agent

You should see it running with:

$ docker ps
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                    COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                    NAMES
59fb0adea3af        wavefront/agent:latest   "/bin/sh run.sh"    48 seconds ago      Up 42 seconds       0.0.0.0:2878->2878/tcp   happy_newton        

You should then be able to send it metrics via graphite format to port 2878:
